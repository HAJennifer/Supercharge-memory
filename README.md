How it is works:
- Present the user with an even number of cards, “face down”.
- When the user clicks a card, “flip it over” and reveal the hidden image.
- When two cards are revealed:
    - If the cards are identical, remove them from play.
    - If they are not, flip them back.
- The game ends when all cards are removed.
-Present the user with a score counter that increments after every card flip.
- Present the user with a star rating.
